# SwitcheoSmartContractExplorer

Welcome to the Switcheo Smart Contract Explorer!

The purpose of this software is to allow convenient querying of a user's balance across multiple smartcontracts and multiple blockchains, for example, if you want to retrieve a user's NEO and ethereum** balances (ethereum coming soon).

You just need input your address and you will see balances all your NEO and ETH** tokens, wich are stored in contracts of Switcheo DEX.

**ETH are going to added after launching ethereum`s smartcontract.

How to try out? Follow these link to try out: https://switchstatistic.000webhostapp.com/

I would be happy to receive your feedback.
