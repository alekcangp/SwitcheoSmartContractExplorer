# SwitcheoSmartContractExplorer

Welcome to the Switcheo Smart Contract Explorer!

The purpose of this software is to allow convenient querying of a user's balance across multiple smartcontracts and multiple blockchains, for example, if you want to retrieve a user's NEO and ethereum** balances (ethereum coming soon).

You just need input your address and you will see balances all your NEO and ETH** tokens, wich are stored in contracts of Switcheo DEX.

**ETH are going to added after launching ethereum`s smartcontract.

Feature:

2. Showing smart contract's transactions (deposit and withdraw)

How to try out? 

1. Follow this link to: https://switchstatistic.000webhostapp.com/
2. Choose the desired contract or leave the default values.
3. Input your NEO address.
4. Press the green button or 'Enter'.

I would be happy to receive your feedback.
